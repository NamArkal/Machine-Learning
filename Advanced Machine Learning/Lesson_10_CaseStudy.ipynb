    "# Operationalization of machine learning models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we cover some of the important themes around model operationalization. This is an extensive topic, and we do not try to be comprehensive here. Instead we learn about some essentials and look at an example of a library that makes this kind of work very easy for us: the `mlflow` library. To introduce you to the library, we go over their [own example](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tutorials-and-examples/tutorial.html) for running an experiment. But first some vocabulary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **script** is some Python code we want to run, stored as a `.py` or `.ipynb` formats. Usually, the script has a set of required or optional inputs we provide (just like a Python function). In `mlflow`, we refer to these inputs as **parameters**, but do NOT confuse this term with model parameters in ML.\n",
    "- A **run** is what we call when we fix the inputs of a script to some value and executing the script. In the context of ML, the script could be a training script, its \"parameters\" could be hyper-parameters to the model we wish to train, and a run is when we train a model with the hyper-parameters set to some fix values.\n",
    "- As part of a run we can log the **parameters** we used, the **metrics** we calculated such as training and test accuracy, and **artifacts** such as plots, tables, or trained models we save externally for reuse later. We can refer to these as run meta-data. In addition to the meta-data we log explicitly in the code, `mlflow` also logs some of its own meta-data such as run ID or run time.\n",
    "- A **experiment** is a collection of related runs. So to continue with the above example, if we execute the script several times each time using another set of values for the hyper-parameters, then the experiment is the collection of all such runs. After executing all the runs, we can go to our experiment to compare them in terms of accuracy, run time, or whatever **metric** of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the example we provide above is a \"typical\" example, and this is what we show in this notebook. But in general we can be flexible in what exactly we define as an experiment. The general idea is that from run to run, we change things and later we want to see what worked and what didn't by looking at metrics or artifacts generated by the model. A machine learning project can consist of one or several experiments. It all depends on the complexity of the proect, and how granular we think of individual runs. This is to some extent a matter of preference and can even be driven by business needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally of course we can do a lot of this manually. After all we know how to run scripts with different inputs, or how to save plots or models on disk. Using a **version control** tool like Git, we can also track changes to the code. So why do we need `mlflow`? The answer is simple: It takes away most of the hassle that comes with doing such things manually, and on top of that it provides us with a UI where we go to find all our runs and quickly compare them. There are other concepts in `mlflow` that we do not cover here, but we invite you to check out [their website](https://mlflow.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, we create a folder to save not only the code, but also the meta-data generated by our runs. Once we begin to log runs, the project folder will be populated by such meta-data. You are advised against deleting the meta-data directly (the better way is to use the UI)."

For example, look [here](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#deploy-a-python-function-model-on-microsoft-azure-ml) for an example of deployment in Azure. There are similar \"plug-ins\" for other cloud providers.\n",

For example, to log metrics, it makes sense to use the Python library and embed `mlflow` in the code. To run experiments and serve models we used the command line and to see and compare runs we used the UI, but in most cases we can also use the Python library, so it's a matter of preference to some extent. As an example, take a look at the next cell, which returns a `DataFrame` with meta-data for runs under our experiment."
